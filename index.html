            <h2 class="title">About</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my engineering portfolio! I am currently a senior at the University of Michigan pursuing a dual Bachelor's 
              degree in Mechanical Engineering and Computer Engineering. I have selected this unique combination of majors for the 
              purpose of equipping myself with the skillsets that are required to pursue a career in robotics, mechatronics, or embedded systems.</p> 
            <p>A few industries that I find particularly fascinating include aerospace, automotive, cloud computing, and med-tech. 
              In the past, I have gained valuable experiences in the cloud computing, med-tech, and automotive fields through summer 
              internship programs with Microsoft, Stryker, and Huf North America, respectively. Collectively, these experiences have 
              positively reinforced my passion for robotics, mechatronics, and embedded systems.</p>
            <p>Outside of academia and work, I enjoy captaining my competitive Bollywood fusion dance team, serving as Vice President of 
              my multicultural fraternity, and golfing with my dad and friends.</p>

            <h2 class="title">Microsoft</h2>
            <h3 class="subtitle">Software Engineer Intern, 2019-2020</h3>
            <p>During my time at Microsoft, I worked as a Software Engineer Intern on the Azure Cloud Hardware and Infrastructure Engineering (CHIE)
               Firmware team. My team was responsible for developing and deploying the Windows Cloud Server system firmware (i.e. the low-level 
               software that initializes and controls the server hardware during bootup and runtime).</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row about-container">

          <div class="col-lg-6 content order-1">
            <h2 class="subheading">SELinator</h2>
            <p>One key feature in our firmware implementation is the system event log (SEL), which maintains a record of all hardware-related events and errors. 
              This telemetry comes in handy when a node goes down and our engineers need to diagnose the root cause of the failure. 
              The SEL is stored as a stream of raw bytes, and prior to my arrival at Microsoft, CHIE engineers would have to manually decode the SEL 
              by referencing the appropriate platform specification, which was a tedious process.</p> 
            <p>My project for the summer of 2019 was to implement a platform-agnostic SEL parsing tool (creatively titled "SELinator") that automated the decoding and filtering 
              of raw SEL data in order to help streamline the redeployment of out-for-repair nodes. Once I completed the bare-bones offline console application, 
              I took the project to the next level of accessibility by hosting SELinator in Azure, designing an interactive bot user interface for the app, 
              and integrating it into Microsoft Teams.</p>
            <p>I can tell that SELinator has truly made an impact because when I came back to Microsoft a year later in 2020, 
              employees across the entire Azure enterprise were using the tool for their day-to-day tasks.</p>

            <h2 class="subheading">CPU Optimization for Power and Performance</h2>
            <p>Many of Azure’s data centers are located in power-scarce regions of the world, and have a rack level power limit of 8.8 kW. 
              These regions are called “small geos,” and it is crucial that power consumption per node is reduced in such regions in order to maximize the number of 
              nodes per rack.</p>
            <p>My project deliverables for the summer of 2020 consisted of three tasks. First I was responsible for implementing power reduction logic within the system firmware for 
              three high-demand SKU's. Next, I was tasked with executing a series of power/performance benchmarking experiments on a test node in order to derive the 
              optimal platform BIOS policies (e.g. active core count, turbo ratio limit) while operating under the reduced power budget. The overarching objective 
              of this optimization was to maximize the platform BIOS policies while avoiding CPU throttling during high-intensity workloads. Finally, once all platform 
              BIOS policies were fine-tuned, I was responsible for merging all the code changes into the master system firmware tree, and writing a suite of 
              test cases for the validation team to run prior to deployment.</p> 
            <p>Overall, this project introduced me to a completely different perspective of the CHIE Firmware team, as it gave me the opportunity to work 
              on a feature that had significant cost benefits and directly impacted the Azure customer experience. All technical experience aside, due to 
              COVID-19 and my 2020 internship with Microsoft being held virtually, I also learned firsthand how large tech corporations function remotely and 
              how to overcome the variety of challenges that inevitably accompany the remote mode of operation.</p>

            <p>At Stryker, I worked as a Software Engineer Intern on the Connected Care team. Connected Care is responsible for defining, developing, 
              and maintaining Stryker's Internet of Things (IoT) platform. Right around the time I joined Stryker, IoT capabilities were just beginning to emerge in 
              the medical device industry, and the Connected Care team was responsible for pioneering this innovation at Stryker. Our interoperability platfrom was built on the foundation 
              of three types of device communication: Device to Device (D2D), Device to Hospital (D2H), and Device to Stryker (D2S). By enabling this vast network of 
              connected medical devices, we opened up several new avenues for Stryker to accomplish its mission to make healthcare better. These avenues included 
              the provision of SaaS features to help customers maximize the lifetime of their instruments and the collection of business intelligence data to support 
              crucial decision-making within new product development teams.</p>
