    <h1>Mitchel Huang</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my engineering portfolio! I am currently a senior at the University of Michigan pursuing a dual Bachelor's 
        degree in Mechanical Engineering and Computer Engineering. I have selected this unique combination of degrees for the 
        purpose of equipping myself with the skillsets that are required to pursue a career in robotics, mechatronics, or embedded systems.</p> 
    <p>A few industries that I find particularly fascinating include aerospace, automotive, cloud computing, and med-tech. 
        In the past, I have gained valuable experiences in the cloud computing, med-tech, and automotive fields through summer 
        internship programs with Microsoft, Stryker, and Huf North America, respectively. Collectively, these experiences have 
        positively reinforced my passion for robotics, mechatronics, and embedded systems.</p>
    <p>Outside of academia and work, I enjoy captaining my competitive Bollywood fusion dance team, serving as Vice President of 
        my multicultural fraternity, and going on golf outings with my friends.</p>
